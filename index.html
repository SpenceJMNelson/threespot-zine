        <p>In last month’s newsletter, we shared how Threespot participated in an <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=b48eb6c6e6&amp;e=57dd2b21da">asset-framing</a> training with <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=dfba4e38a6&amp;e=57dd2b21da">Trabian Shorters</a> of <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=31a4541c82&amp;e=57dd2b21da">BMe Community</a>. One of the biggest takeaways from the training was that as members of the service and social justice sector, our responsibility is not only to help communities and tackle tough issues, but to be aware of how our language and attitudes influence our work as well. In our attempts to relay the gravity of whatever “problem” we are trying to solve, we often fall into the trap of representing the communities we are trying to help as incapable victims, and even as problems themselves.</p>
        <p>During the training, we completed an exercise in which we brought examples of organizations and companies who are problem-solving by using a positive approach, framing the nature of the people they are trying to help as assets rather than liabilities. One organization that quickly came to mind was our client, <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=7b4b0a3667&amp;e=57dd2b21da">CLLCTIVLY</a>, a social change organization based in Baltimore that was founded by Jamye Wooten in response to the death of Freddie Gray. Through their platform, CLLCTIVLY amplifies and connects Black-led organizations and Black-owned businesses in greater Baltimore.</p>
        <p>In its messaging, CLLCTIVLY does not bombard readers with stats about the problems Baltimore is facing and how they’re solving them. There is no pseudo-savior messaging to be found, and no tear-jerking imagery of impoverished people or struggling businesses. What readers do see are the programs and actions CLLCTIVLY undertakes to provide resources to already impactful and activated organizations and people in the greater Baltimore community. The focus is not on “under”—underachieving, underserved, underutilized—anything. CLLCTIVLY instead highlights and thrives on bringing people together to create a collaborative, celebratory ecosystem of changemakers who are already solving their problems.</p>
        <p>The intent to help is never a bad thing. But in looking at the world today and acknowledging the seemingly insurmountable problems compounding at every turn, one wonders what kind of solutions we could unearth by reshaping the framework of what social justice communications means. The possibilities are endless if we follow CLLCTIVLY’s lead and, instead of inadvertently compounding the issue by making the people the problem, we foster a spirit of collaboration and self-empowerment among those already changing lives, thus amplifying their impact.</p>

        <p>I bet you’re familiar with <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=9ce24c3aad&amp;e=57dd2b21da">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the inventor of the <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=77786a4ebb&amp;e=57dd2b21da">World Wide Web</a>, but what about his brother, Mike? I first saw his name in this BBC post on climate change, “<a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=001e955758&amp;e=57dd2b21da">Why your internet habits are not as clean as you think</a>.” Turns out <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=69cde6d279&amp;e=57dd2b21da">Mike Berners-Lee</a> is a professor and expert on carbon footprints. Back in 2010, he calculated that the typical business user of the Internet generates as much CO2 from a single year of email as they would driving a non-electric car for 200 miles.</p>
        <p>It’s hard to imagine something as innocuous as sending an email contributing to climate change, but every little thing we do online adds up. With over 4.5 billion internet users worldwide and growing, it’s no surprise digital technologies account for <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=3eaf1e49de&amp;e=57dd2b21da">4% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>, about the same as the entire airline industry. But how much can any of us do about it?</p>
        <p>It’s true—there are many factors outside of our control when it comes to a site’s carbon footprint. We can’t always choose the greenest possible hosting provider due to cost or internal policies. We can’t dictate where our users get their electricity from or how far away they live from our servers. But what we can control is how much data and electricity are required to load our website.</p>
        <p>To take it to the extreme, you could make a text-only version of your site with no images, styling, or JavaScript. NPR did this back in 2005 with <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=f38f3d5ee4&amp;e=57dd2b21da">https://text.npr.org</a> for people with limited data and low bandwidth, and during <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=10ac7bd3ad&amp;e=57dd2b21da">emergencies</a> when people need to preserve their battery. It generates 3,000 times less CO2 than their regular site (<a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=8083131ce6&amp;e=57dd2b21da">1</a>, <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=0bc37658fa&amp;e=57dd2b21da">2</a>). It’s also much faster than their regular site, and easier to navigate for people using a screen reader (their regular site is still pretty good, though). CNN also has <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=41b43a9941&amp;e=57dd2b21da">http://lite.cnn.com</a> and Twitter launched a <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=7e5b089336&amp;e=57dd2b21da">lite version in 2017</a> that <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=23b711600a&amp;e=57dd2b21da">b</a><a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=b5ae220b47&amp;e=57dd2b21da">ecame their regular site</a> last summer.</p>
        <p>For everyone else, though, this approach isn’t feasible. Organizations need images and videos to tell engaging stories, JavaScript to power donation forms, and styling to define their brand. Instead, we must balance those features and functionality with the CO2 output, all of which are tied directly to the total page weight. Even if our servers use green energy, we still want to reduce the energy required for our users to view our site, which is especially important on high-traffic sites.</p>
        <p>Reducing the number of images and videos and optimizing the remaining ones is a great place to start since images typically make up over <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=fdfbafdaca&amp;e=57dd2b21da">50%</a> of page weight. Perhaps instead of a trendy full-screen banner image or video, consider experimenting with large typography, gradients, and SVGs—all of which can scale to any size without losing fidelity or affecting page weight. Your website should also automatically optimize and resize images so that users don’t waste bandwidth.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is typically the next biggest culprit after images. Developers often use third-party plugins and libraries in an effort to save time, but it can quickly balloon if limits aren’t set. This is why I advocate for setting <a href="https://threespot.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bcd8bfaef17a81228e3934f89&amp;id=3877eacb22&amp;e=57dd2b21da">performance budgets</a> at the start of a project. It allows us to have conversations about features vs. performance proactively during the build process instead of after the site goes live, when it’s already too late.</p>
